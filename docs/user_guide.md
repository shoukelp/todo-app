# Usage Scenarios

Here are some examples of how users can utilize this app:

* **Quick Try Without Account:** A new user wants to quickly jot down some ideas. He selects “Continue as Guest”, adding 3 tasks with different priorities. Later, if he feels the need to keep this data permanently and across devices, he can select “Back to Login” and register/login with a Google or Email account.
* **Daily Task Management:** The user logs in with his email account every morning. He adds tasks like “Reply to Client X email (High)”, “Buy groceries (Medium)”, “Schedule team meeting (Medium)”. Throughout the day, he marks completed tasks with a checkbox.
* **Focus on the Unfinished:** The to-do list is already long. The user wants to focus on what needs to be done. He uses the "Show: Active" filter to hide all completed tasks.
* **Search for Specific Tasks:** The user remembers adding a task about “monthly report” but forgets the details. He sorted by "Sort By: Alphabetical (A-Z)" to make visual search in the task list easier.
* **Review Tasks by Priority:** The user wants to do the most important tasks first. Although there is no sort by priority, it can visually identify “High” priority tasks (🔴) easily.
* **Edit Mistakes:** The user mistyped the task name. He clicks “Edit”, corrects the text, and then clicks “Save”.
